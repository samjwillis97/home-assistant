  Controls the dining room lights.

  When motion is detected and the light level is low it will turn them on.

  It will then turn them off once the room has been cleared for 30 minutes.

  Note: Requires motion sensor to be configured (binary_sensor.dining_room_motion_sensor_motion,
  binary_sensor.dining_room_motion_sensor_occupancy, sensor.dining_room_motion_sensor_illuminance).

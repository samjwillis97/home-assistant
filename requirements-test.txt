# Testing dependencies for Home Assistant automation testing
#
# IMPORTANT: It's recommended to install these in a Python virtual environment:
#   python3 -m venv venv
#   source venv/bin/activate
#   pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Core testing dependencies - lightweight approach
pytest>=8.0.0
pytest-asyncio>=0.23.0
pytest-cov>=5.0.0
PyYAML>=6.0

# Note: Full Home Assistant testing requires complex dependencies
# For now, we use a lightweight validation-only approach
# To use full integration testing, install manually:
#   pip install pytest-homeassistant-custom-component==0.13.109

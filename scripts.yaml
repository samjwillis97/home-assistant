# This file is used by the scripts editor
# in the Home Assistant frontend.
#
# I personally do not use it, mainly because I like doing this in YAML.
# However, from time to time, it is helpful to click a bit and see
# what the frontend makes of it.
#
# This file must exist for the frontend scripts editor to work.
# Hence, it is here, empty.

# If you are looking for my scripts: See scripts folder.
